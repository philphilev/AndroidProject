I am bored App

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:

The purpose of this app is for me to find and sort interesting activities that I can perform when aimlessly refreshing reddit.
It can, of course, be used by other users, nevertheless, currently i expect to be the sole user. 
It has a potential to be something interesting as it can include multiple activities such as streaming, gaming, books and even more.
It will utilize open APIs in order to sort and store certain data based on choices in the application.
